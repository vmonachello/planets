Cold, dry. Barely any B-field left. Smaller than Earth. Solidified core.
I don' really get why they want to colonise Mars because the rad. levels are high due to lack of magnetosphere. Also no oxygen.
OKay, maybe they can terraform, but that doesn't help with the radiation.

Additional add (for testing purposes).

Mars is the 4th planet from the sun, but there are only conisdered to be 8 planets in the system of Sol now. :( Bye, Pluto.

Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
